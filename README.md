Data science involves extracting insights from raw data using statistical, machine learning, and computational techniques. This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline, starting from data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and deployment using Flask.
House price prediction is a significant application of machine learning, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate companies make informed decisions. This project follows a structured data science pipeline, covering data collection, preprocessing, model development, and deployment using Flask. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on numerical and categorical features.
The dataset used for this project consists of various features influencing house prices, such as lot area, overall quality, year built, neighborhood, and house style. The data is obtained from a real estate dataset, typically available from sources like Kaggle or property listings. The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables, which require proper handling before feeding them into a machine learning model.
Before training the model, the data undergoes several preprocessing steps to improve quality and accuracy
After preprocessing and analyzing the data, the next step is to build a predictive model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed as a web-based application using Flask. Flask provides a lightweight framework to serve the machine learning model as an API.

Building a Flask API
The Flask application creates an interface where users can input house details such as lot area, overall quality, year built, neighborhood, and house style. The model processes these inputs and predicts the estimated house price.

User Interaction
Users enter house details through a web interface or API request.
The trained model processes the input and returns a predicted house price.
The application can be hosted on a cloud platform for accessibility.
This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline, from data collection to model deployment. By combining machine learning techniques with Flask, we create a practical and accessible house price prediction system. This project can be further enhanced by incorporating more features, improving model accuracy, and developing a user-friendly interface
